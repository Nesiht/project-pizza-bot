# Pizza Bot

This week's project was about practicing JS, so we had to build a pizza bot in pairs (with @Nesiht)

First, we built one huge function, that included everything and it was trickier than we thought to take it apart but we managed in the end. 

We are quite proud that our bot includes error messages, in case you order 0 or negative amount of pizzas or if you order a pizza that's not on the menu.
